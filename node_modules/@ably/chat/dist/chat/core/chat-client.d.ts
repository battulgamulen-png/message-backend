     * Creates a new ChatClient instance for interacting with Ably Chat.
     *
     * The ChatClient is the main entry point for the Ably Chat SDK. It requires a Realtime client
     * and provides access to chat rooms through the rooms property.
     *
     * **Important**: The Ably Realtime client must have a clientId set. This identifies
     * the user in chat rooms and is required for all chat operations.
     *
     * **NOTE**: You can provide optional overrides to the {@link ChatClient}, these will be merged
     * with the default options. See {@link ChatClientOptions} for the available options.
     * @param realtime - An initialized Ably Realtime client with a configured clientId
     * @param clientOptions - Optional configuration for the chat client
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * import * as Ably from 'ably';
     * import { ChatClient, LogLevel } from '@ably/chat';
     *
     * // Preferred in production: Use auth URL that returns a JWT
     * const realtimeClientWithJWT = new Ably.Realtime({
     *   authUrl: '/api/ably-auth', // Your server endpoint that returns a JWT with clientId
     *   authMethod: 'POST'
     * });
     *
     * const chatClient = new ChatClient(realtimeClientWithJWT)
     *```
     * @example
     *```typescript
     * // Alternative for development and server-side operations: Set clientId directly (requires API key)
     * const realtimeClientWithKey = new Ably.Realtime({
     *   key: 'your-ably-api-key',
     *   clientId: 'user-123'
     * });
     *
     * const chatClient = new ChatClient(realtimeClientWithKey)
     * ```
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * const realtimeClient = new Ably.Realtime({
     *   authUrl: '/api/ably-auth',
     *   authMethod: 'POST'
     * });
     *
     * // With custom logging configuration: Defaults to LogLevel.Info and console logging
     * const chatClientWithLogging = new ChatClient(realtimeClient, {
     *   logLevel: LogLevel.Debug,
     *   logHandler: (message, level, context) => {
     *     // Send to your logging service
     *     yourLoggerInstance.log({
